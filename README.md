# HMM4GA (Hidden Markov Models for Genome Analysis)

The project aims to the development of the implementation of the pair HMM algorithm for genomic sequence analysis described in the
[**reference documents**](https://github.com/LeoGori/HMM4GA/tree/main/references), while introducing parallel
computation through the use of [**OpenMP**](https://www.openmp.org/) APIs
